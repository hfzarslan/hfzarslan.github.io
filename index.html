                    <h3>NL-to-SQL Agent for Healthcare Analytics POC</h3>
                    <p class="intro">I led the technical design and implementation of a Proof of Concept aimed at democratizing data access for field teams. I built an agentic workflow capable of interpreting plain English queries and executing them against a complex analytics database.</p>
                    <p class="intro">By leveraging LangChain’s SQL Agent, I solved the challenge of mapping unstructured user questions to structured database schemas. The POC successfully delivered accurate insights on provider counts and geo-level metrics, effectively validating that a conversational AI interface could significantly reduce the dependency on manual reporting.</p>
                    <h3>Big Data Analytics Pipeline for Pharma Strategy</h3>
                    <p class="intro">Engineered a large-scale HCP Influence Mapping System to optimize pharmaceutical sales targeting. I built a comprehensive pipeline that synthesizes multi-source claims activity (Dx/Rx/Px) and complex market basket definitions to create a unified 'provider universe.' This system segments over 400,000 active physicians, analyzing patient-sharing patterns rather than just isolation volume.</p>
                    <p class="intro">By applying graph-based community detection and multi-factor influence scoring, the solution identifies Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs) and hidden referral clusters that drive prescribing behaviors. These insights were integrated directly into a commercial visualization platform, allowing sales teams to visualize practice connections and execute precise, data-driven territory alignment.</p>

                    <h3>Agentic AI Chatbot for Customer Intelligence</h3>
                    <p class="intro">I architected and built a comprehensive Agentic AI system that merges operational analytics with predictive intelligence. The solution features a schema-aware NL-to-SQL engine, allowing non-technical teams to query live transaction data—including revenue patterns and regional demand—using natural language.</p>
                    <p class="intro">Beyond retrieval, I integrated automated predictive pipelines for Customer Churn and CLTV, establishing a scheduled retraining loop to ensure model freshness. The core innovation was the agentic orchestration layer: a reasoning engine that dynamically routes user requests between the SQL database and machine learning models, synthesizing multi-source results into a single business response. This system effectively centralized data access for marketing and operations teams.</p>

                    <h3>Sensor Fusion for Terrain Classification</h3>
                    <p class="intro">Led the development of a real-time system designed to detect off-road events without relying on GPS. I engineered a multi-modal data collection framework using ROS, capturing telemetry from IMU, OBD-II, and visual sensors across diverse highway and off-road environments.</p>
                    <p class="intro">The core challenge was translating raw noise into signal. I implemented advanced feature engineering—focusing on vibration profiling and statistical transformations—to train a robust classification model. I successfully operationalized a Linear SVM that could identify off-road tracks based solely on vehicle motion dynamics, providing a foundational layer for fleet safety analytics and predictive maintenance products.</p>

                    <h3>Agentic RAG Financial Analyst Chatbot</h3>
                    <p class="intro">Architected a specialized Agentic RAG system designed to analyze the financial performance of 50+ PSX-listed companies. I engineered a robust data pipeline that utilizes Gemini models for multimodal ingestion, applying semantic chunking to process complex quarterly and annual reports into a ChromaDB vector store.</p>
                    <p class="intro">The core logic is built on OpenAI’s Agents SDK, featuring a hybrid retrieval engine and a multi-tool agentic workflow. This architecture allows the system to autonomously perform multi-step reasoning—executing trend analysis, sector comparisons, and dividend evaluations. The platform transforms dense, unstructured financial documents into a conversational analytics assistant capable of computing key ratios and delivering precise, citation-backed market insights.</p>
