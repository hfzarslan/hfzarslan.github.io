                    <h3>NL-to-SQL Agent for Healthcare Analytics POC</h3>
                    <p class="intro">I led the technical design and implementation of a Proof of Concept aimed at democratizing data access for field teams. I built an agentic workflow capable of interpreting plain English queries and executing them against a complex analytics database.</p>
                    <p class="intro">By leveraging LangChain’s SQL Agent, I solved the challenge of mapping unstructured user questions to structured database schemas. The POC successfully delivered accurate insights on provider counts and geo-level metrics, effectively validating that a conversational AI interface could significantly reduce the dependency on manual reporting.</p>
                    <h3>Big Data Analytics Pipeline for Pharma Strategy</h3>
                    <p class="intro">I developed a comprehensive Spark-based big data pipeline that processes large-scale healthcare datasets from Veeva, IQVIA, and Symphony. Running on EMR clusters, the pipeline ingests raw data, performs data standardization, and generates actionable insights for pharma brand teams. It incorporates market basket analysis, focus-drug patterns, diagnostic correlations, and robust statistical transformations to help clients understand healthcare provider behavior. An advanced graph analytics layer identifies clusters and communities of HCPs across North America, highlighting influential physicians who drive prescribing behavior in specific specialties. The analytics backbone supports 400,000+ HCP profiles, enabling clients to fine-tune targeting and marketing strategies with precision. I also handled recurring ad-hoc analytical requests that required engineering custom KPIs and deep exploratory analysis for brand performance reviews.</p>

                    <h3>Agentic AI Chatbot for Customer Intelligence</h3>
                    <p class="intro">As a freelance consultant, I designed an end-to-end agentic AI chatbot that unified customer intelligence, operational analytics, and predictive modeling for a UK-based ride-hailing startup. The assistant uses a schema-aware NL-to-SQL module to translate natural language queries into accurate database operations, enabling teams to fetch insights like customer activity, revenue patterns, high-demand regions, and retention segments without writing SQL. I integrated two predictive pipelines—churn prediction and CLTV scoring—that update automatically through scheduled retraining, ensuring fresh model outputs as new transaction data arrives. The chatbot orchestrates multiple tools using an agentic workflow, intelligently deciding when to query databases, when to run churn or CLTV models, and how to combine multi-step results into a single, business-friendly response. By consolidating analytics, predictions, and segment exploration into one conversational interface, the system transformed how marketing, operations, and management teams interact with data.</p>

                    <h3>Real-time Off-road Driving Detection System</h3>
                    <p class="intro">During my time at Motive, I built a real-time off-road event detection system using IMU, GPS, OBD-II, and camera data through an IoT-enabled sensor fusion architecture. I designed a multi-sensor data collection module using ROS, deployed in field vehicles across various terrains including highways, city roads, and off-road tracks. The collected time-series dataset underwent intensive feature engineering, including vibration signatures, statistical profiles, and frequency-domain transformations. I experimented with SVM, ANN, and Random Forest models but ultimately deployed a Linear SVM optimized for stable performance across varied road conditions. By enabling systems to detect hazardous and off-road environments based solely on multi-sensor motion signatures—rather than relying heavily on GPS—the solution provided the foundation for improving fleet safety analytics and predictive maintenance for commercial vehicles.</p>

                    <p class="intro">I built an Agentic RAG Financial Analyst that analyzes 50+ PSX-listed companies using quarterly and annual reports. The system ingests documents through a Gemini-based pipeline, applies semantic chunking, and stores data in ChromaDB. With a hybrid retrieval setup and a multi-function agent using OpenAI’s Agents SDK, it performs trend analysis, sector comparisons, and dividend evaluations. The result is a conversational financial assistant that retrieves data across reports, computes key ratios, and delivers clear, data-backed insights—demonstrating my expertise in RAG, LLM engineering, and agentic workflow design.</p>
