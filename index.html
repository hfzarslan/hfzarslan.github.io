                <p class="intro">I am a Senior Data Scientist with 6+ years of industry experience in building Enterprise Machine Learning, Generative AI, and Agentic AI systems for large-scale production environments. My work spans healthcare, pharma analytics, customer intelligence, and financial analysis — with a strong focus on solving real business problems through intelligent automation, scalable data pipelines, and modern LLM-based architectures.</p>
                
                <p class="intro">My expertise sits at the intersection of LLM engineering, agentic design patterns, advanced retrieval (RAG/CRAG/Self-RAG), data engineering, and applied machine learning. I specialize in building deployment-ready AI systems that integrate structured + unstructured data, use tool/function calling, and provide reliable multi-step reasoning for complex business queries.</p>
                
                <p class="intro">Over the years, I've designed end-to-end solutions such as NL-to-SQL agents, agentic customer intelligence chatbots, enterprise RAG platforms, big data analytics pipelines, churn & CLTV models, and real-time ML systems using sensor fusion. I also work extensively with Spark, PySpark, vector databases, LLM orchestration frameworks.</p>
